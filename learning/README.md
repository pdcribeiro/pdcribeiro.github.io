## Steps

1. Clarify requirements — ask probing questions to refine intent

* core goal
* main/first pain to solve
* mvp features

2. Think structurally — how to break problem into pure logic and shell layers

3. Define responsibilities — core vs UI vs effects

4. Write spec — minimal description of expected behavior

5. Decide tradeoffs — encourage me to document reasoning and consider alternatives
